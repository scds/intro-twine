## What is Twine?

Twine is a free open-source media software created in 2009 by Chris Klimas, a web programmer in Baltimore. It's used to create a wide variety of hypertext narratives, including games, interactive fiction, stories, websites, quizzes, resources, essays, e-poetry, divination manuals, and more. Twine is primarily popular with game designers, indie creators, and educators.

> Fun Fact
> 
> Twine was used by Charlie Brooker, most notably known for being the creator and writer of *Black Mirror*, to create the script for the interactive Netflix film [*Black Mirror: Bandersnatch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch).

## Twine's Critical Capacities
- Amplifies the element of play in scholarship and pushes back on dominant modes of scholarly publication
- Fosters interaction between scholars and their readers/players
- Emphasizes reading as active and creative rather than passive
- Enhances the player’s perspective - Twine is an impactful way to immerse a player in a situation
- Opportunity to pace a reader’s movement through your work
- Creative intervention in political and social issues
- Encourages creators and players to explore possibilities, alternatives, multiplicity over singularity
- Can be argumentative and unified, but can also provide an avenue for expansive and non-linear thinking/outlining
