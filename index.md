# Introduction to Twine

This module will introduce you to Twine, a beginner-friendly platform for building interactive fiction. We will discuss how to create a Twine game, how to customize it, and how to publish it online for others to see.

These tutorials were made for HUM2DH3: Creative, Collaborative, Critical: Introduction to Digital Scholarship. Sections of the videos relate directly to an assignment where students create a retelling of Frankenstein through a Twine Game. However, the majority of each video functions as a general introduction to Twine Games.

Asynchronous Tutorials by Veronica Litt, Digital Scholarship Coordinator. [Book an appointment with Veronica or another member of the Sherman Centre Team.](https://libcal.mcmaster.ca/appointments/)
