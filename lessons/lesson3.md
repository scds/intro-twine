## Twine Code Cheat Sheet

Throughout this lesson, we'll be referencing [this Twine Code Cheat Sheet](
https://mcmasteru365-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/littvs_mcmaster_ca/EUZxxT7qrPBPpqtEW6ULoUkBTCTT8tRZBhNkRbpeuPO06A?rtime=Qy8ejxp-20g).

You should keep it open in a new tab while working on your Twine game, as it'll come handy often.

## Creating Links

While we've already created passage links, which links the player to another passage of the story, this time we'll be creating website links. You'll notice that, if you simply copy paste a URL into your passage, it'll just stay as plain text and it won't be clickable.

If you take a look at the Twine Code Cheat Sheet, the code to insert a link to a webpage is `<a href="URL">[text reader will see]</a>`. Replace the `URL` with your website link, and replace the `text reader will see` with your display text (similar to how we had display text for passage links).
