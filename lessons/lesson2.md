## Text Styles
To apply some text styles to your text...
- Highlight the text you'd like to apply the styling to.
- Open up the `Styles` menu.
- Select the styling you'd like.

If all went according to plan, your text should be formatted similarly to the style itself. It should also be surrounded by a symbol at the start and end. Those signify the text style, similarly to how square brackets [[ ]] signify a link, so they won't be seen in the game itself.

### Additional Text Styles
If bold, italic, strikethrough, and superscript aren't enough, there's an extra menu with a lot more options.
- Highlight the text you'd like to apply the styling to.
- Open up the `Styles` menu.
- Click on `More Styles`.

- Create the text style you'd like and click `Add`.

{: .note }
You can scroll down to see more options for the text styles.

There's lots of customization available in this menu, allowing for font variants, underlines, strikes, superscripts, subscripts, outlines, letter spacing, flips, stretches, and animations.

## Colours
If you'd like to change the font colour or the colour of the text background...
- Highlight the text you'd like to apply the colouring to.
- Open up the `Colours` menu.
<img width="75%" alt="choosing the colours button" src="../assets/img/lessons/text5.png" style="border: solid 2px black"> 
- Select the styling you'd like.
<img width="75%" alt="selecting colours with example text" src="../assets/img/lessons/text6.png" style="border: solid 2px black"> 

There's a lot of customization here too, allowing for gradients and custom colour selection. Take some time to play around with these settings!

- Highlight the text you'd like to apply the border to.

Being able to modify each side of the border allows for some interesting possibilities.

## Rotated Text
You can also rotate text!
- Highlight the text you'd like to apply the rotation to.

- Select the styling you'd like.

Rotating text may seem a little niche, but there's some really cool effects you can do with it.

## Lists
Bulleted and numbered lists are another thing you can make.
- Highlight the text you'd like to make a list item.
- Open up the `List and line items` menu.
<img width="75%" alt="selecting list and line items button" src="../assets/img/lessons/text14.png" style="border: solid 2px black">
- Select the list type you'd like.

## Alignment and Columns
Finally, the last text formatting option we'll cover is alignment and columns.

### Alignment
- Highlight the text you'd like to change the alignment of.
- Open up the `Alignments and columns` menu and select `Alignment`.
<img width="75%" alt="selecting the alignment button" src="../assets/img/lessons/text16.png" style="border: solid 2px black">
- Adjust the placement and width of your text and select the text alignment.
<img width="75%" alt="adjusting alignment with some example text" src="../assets/img/lessons/text17.png" style="border: solid 2px black">

### Columns
- Do **not** highlight any text. Select an empty area.
- Open up the `Alignments and columns` menu and select `Columns`.
<img width="75%" alt="choosing the columns button" src="../assets/img/lessons/text18.png" style="border: solid 2px black">
- Adjust the number of columns and cell sizes.
<img width="75%" alt="columns settings" src="../assets/img/lessons/text19.png" style="border: solid 2px black">
- Move your text into the designated text area created for you.
<img width="75%" alt="moving our text into the columns" src="../assets/img/lessons/text20.png" style="border: solid 2px black">

Twine allows for in-depth positioning and column editing that's rarely found in other applications.
